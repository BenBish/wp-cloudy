WP Cloudy is a powerful weather plugin for WordPress, based on Open Weather Map API, using Custom Post Types and shortcodes, and much more.

== Description ==

WP Cloudy is a flexible and easy to use weather plugin that allows you to create unlimited differents weather using Custom Post Types and Open Weather Map API. 

Create a weather, select your city, choose the options and customize the look in a few clicks.

Embed it anywhere with the shortcode automatically generated by copy and paste in posts, pages, text widgets, or directly in the PHP files of your theme.
